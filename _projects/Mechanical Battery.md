<h2>Concept Exploration and Selection</h2>
A variety of mechanical energy storage systems were brainstormed and a selection matrix was used to find the system that best fit the problem.
<ul>
  <li><strong>Potential Concepts:</strong><br>
    - Pumped Hydro<br>
    - Flywheel<br>
    - Compression Spring System<br>
    - Rubber Band Pulley</li>
</ul>

We scored all potential systems in these 5 categories, higher is better.
<ul>
  <li><strong>Evaluation Criteria:</strong><br>
    - Cost<br>
    - Energy Stored<br>
    - Efficiency<br>
    - Complexity<br>
    - Safety</li>
</ul>

The rubber band and pulley system was chosen at a score of 3.2, due its simplicity, ease of construction, and cost.


<h2>Prototype Development and Testing</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Key Components:</strong><br>
    - Elastic bands<br>

    - Analyzed data and findings to identify strengths and weaknesses</li>
</ol>

<h2>Budget Management and Resource Allocation</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Budget Constraints:</strong><br>
    - Defined project budget and contingency funds</li>
  <li><strong>Expense Tracking:</strong><br>
    - Monitored project expenses and adjusted spending to stay within budget</li>
</ol>

<h2>Project Management and Collaboration</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Task Assignment:</strong><br>
    - Assigned roles and responsibilities to team members based on expertise</li>
  <li><strong>Communication:</strong><br>
