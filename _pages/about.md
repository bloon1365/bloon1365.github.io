I'm currently studying at Simon Fraser University, working towards becoming a mechatronic systems engineer. My focus lies in robotics, embedded systems, and software development. Throughout my studies, I'm delving into merging software and hardware to innovate in the realm of robotic platforms and diverse software applications.

I've gained expertise in the process of designing, integrating, and testing robotic platforms. I've held various leadership positions within teams, spanning from 4 to 20 members.

I will complete my Bachelor's degree in Mechatronic Systems Engineering from Simon Fraser University in 2025. This website provides a comprehensive view of my work experiences, projects, and related activities.
